        "description": "A dune is a landform composed of wind- or water-driven sand. It typically takes the form of a mound, ridge, or hill. An area with dunes is called a dune system or a dune complex. A large dune complex is called a dune field, while broad, flat regions covered with wind-swept sand or dunes with little or no vegetation are called ergs or sand seas. Dunes occur in different shapes and sizes, but most kinds of dunes are longer on the stoss (upflow) side, where the sand is pushed up the dune, and have a shorter slip face in the lee side. The valley or trough between dunes is called a dune slack.",

        "description": "A series of aerial landscapes from Namibia, exploring abstraction in landscapes. Aerial photography provides an element of duality and ambiguity. The images are, at least temporarily, removed from their reality they take on different forms and in some cases appear to be of microscopic origins or reminiscent of something else entirely. This ambiguity and departure from reality is what intrigues and inspires my work. All images where taken from Cessna light aircraft or helicopters with doors removed using a medium format camera. I love the direct feedback looking through the camera at my subject and responding to what I see.",
